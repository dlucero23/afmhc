<p>AFMHC is the most well-respected clinic in the Southwest, The lead psychotherapist has over 31 years worth of experience, and over the years has developed a special interest in creating and building mental health awareness.</p>

<p>More recently, AFMHC is focusing more on seminars and the overall education of people on the pressing topics concerning mental health including managing stress from money, PTSD, self-esteem, and others.</p>

<p>Since we are now entering into the age of the smartphone, and we are already deep into the age of the computer, we here at <a href="http://siamtek.com">Siam Tek</a> believe that such a well-respected therapist and practice deserves a modern, clean and clearly communicated website, so people can visit the website and know exactly what AFMHC is all about, and how the clinic can help those in need to overcome some of the deepest mental and emotional challenges that they are confronted with.</p>

<p>This project is an attempt at bringing all of these ideas together cohesively into a beautifully designed, practical website.</p>

<a name="instructions-for-commits" class="anchor" href="#instructions-for-commits"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions for Commits</h3>

<p>It's extremely important to label each commit and include short descriptions.  </p>

<p>Why? It helps to save time in the future, as the files get larger and harder to manage, and if for any reason there are several conflicting commits from several sources at one time.</p>
