It helps to save time in the future, as the files get larger and harder to manage, and if for any reason there are several conflicting commits from several sources at one time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions concerning this project or more info on how to commit to this project, see the \"Support or Contact\" section below.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**Lead Designer:**\r\n@dlucero23: Diego Lucero, Lead Visionary, Chief Creative Officer for [Siam Tek](http://siamtek.com)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n**Project Contact:**\r\ncontact Diego at dluceroppc@gmail.com, and I will respond as soon as I am able.\r\n\r\n**Github Support:**\r\ncontact support@github.com and they are great at helping you to sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
